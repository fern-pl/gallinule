# Gallinule

> [!NOTE]
>
> Gallinule is currently not undergoing development here, and this repository is largely untouched until changes made in the Fern language become public again, as it is currently being worked on under new architecture as the Sol compiler framework.

> [!WARNING]
>
> In the current state of Gallinule it is effectively entirely dysfunctional. This may be fixed and branched off as an independent comptime assembler library in the future.

Incredibly quick and dynamic comptime assembler designed to allow for compiling CIL, x86, x86_64, and much more with minimal overhead and maximal throughput.
